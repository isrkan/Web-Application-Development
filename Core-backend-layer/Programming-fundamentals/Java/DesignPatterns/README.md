# Design patterns in Java

**Design patterns** are tried-and-tested solutions to common problems in software design. Rather than reinventing the wheel for each programming challenge, developers can use these patterns as templates to handle recurring problems in a consistent, effective way. Design patterns encapsulate best practices refined over time and help streamline communication between developers by providing a shared language for certain classes of problems and solutions.

Each design pattern typically addresses a specific design problem, such as:
- How to structure relationships between objects,
- How to make code more reusable and flexible,
- How to facilitate easy maintenance and scaling of systems.

Using design patterns improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability, making applications easier to understand and manage as they grow in complexity.

## Types of design patterns
Design patterns fall into three primary categories:

1. **Creational patterns**: These patterns deal with the instantiation of objects. They provide ways to create objects while keeping the creation logic separate from the core application logic. This can be particularly useful for managing complex creation logic or controlling access to instance creation.
   - **Examples**: Singleton, factory method, abstract factory, builder, and prototype patterns.

2. **Structural patterns**: These patterns focus on the relationships between objects. They help create flexible and reusable structures by defining how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures. Structural patterns are beneficial for designing class hierarchies and creating flexible and efficient architecture.
   - **Examples**: Adapter, bridge, composite, decorator, facade, flyweight, and proxy patterns.

3. **Behavioral patterns**: These patterns deal with the interaction and communication between objects. They help manage responsibilities between objects and increase the flexibility of the application by allowing various objects to interact without being tightly coupled.
   - **Examples**: Observer, strategy, command, chain of responsibility, state, template method, visitor, and memento patterns.

Each of these types addresses a specific aspect of software design, from object creation to data sharing, structure, and behavior, providing a balanced approach to developing robust and scalable applications. However, it’s essential to understand that using a design pattern also comes with trade-offs. For example:
- **Complexity vs. simplicity**: Patterns can add complexity to the code, especially for simpler problems. It’s essential to evaluate whether the added complexity of a pattern is justified by the benefits it provides.
- **Performance overheads**: Some patterns, like Observer, might introduce performance overheads, especially in applications that require real-time processing or low latency.
- **Memory usage**: Patterns like Singleton and Memento can affect memory usage and should be applied thoughtfully.

When choosing a design pattern, carefully assess its intent, benefits, and possible trade-offs.

## Design principles underpinning patterns
The following design principles serve as the foundation for most patterns, guiding Java developers to write modular, flexible, and maintainable code:

1. **Encapsulation**: Design patterns leverage encapsulation by hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary methods to the rest of the application. Encapsulation enables patterns to focus on "what" an object does rather than "how" it accomplishes its task, enhancing code abstraction and security.
2. **Abstraction**: By focusing on high-level interfaces and hiding details, patterns help manage complexity. Abstraction in patterns allows developers to interact with an interface without needing to understand the specific underlying implementation, making code more adaptable and extendable.
3. **Separation of concerns**: This principle promotes dividing functionality among different components, with each component responsible for a single concern. Design patterns often help achieve this by providing roles and boundaries, like the “observer” and “subject” in the observer pattern, ensuring each component focuses on a single responsibility.
4. **Loose coupling and high cohesion**: Design patterns strive to reduce dependencies between components (loose coupling) while ensuring that related functionality is grouped together (high cohesion). Loose coupling makes the codebase more modular and flexible, while high cohesion keeps code organized and easy to navigate.
5. **Open/closed principle (OCP)**: This principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Many design patterns embody OCP by creating structures that allow easy extension without requiring changes to the existing code, such as using interfaces or abstract classes.
6. **Liskov substitution principle (LSP)**: This principle emphasizes that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without altering the behavior of the application. Patterns such as the factory method and strategy patterns utilize LSP to allow for flexibility in how instances are created or behaviors are assigned.
7. **Dependency inversion principle (DIP)**: This principle suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions. Dependency injection (DI) is a popular pattern that demonstrates this principle, making code more adaptable by allowing dependencies to be injected at runtime rather than hard-coded.
8. **Interface segregation principle (ISP)**: According to ISP, clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Design patterns often rely on focused interfaces rather than large ones, helping clients only access what is necessary for their functionality.

## When and how to use design patterns
Design patterns should be applied when they solve a problem effectively in a specific context. Some tips for implementing them successfully include:
1. **Understand the problem thoroughly**: Before choosing a pattern, analyze the problem and identify the specific architectural challenges we are facing.
2. **Select the right pattern**: Each pattern serves a specific purpose, so select the one that aligns with the problem's nature and requirements.
3. **Ensure clear documentation**: Design patterns can add complexity, so document the pattern, its purpose, and how it’s implemented. This helps other developers understand its role in the system.
4. **Avoid overuse of patterns**: Not every problem requires a design pattern. Overusing patterns can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code. Use them judiciously, keeping code simplicity and readability in mind.
